First, process some data.

```{r}
source("shared.R")
```

```{sql, connection=con, output.var="results"}
select alliance.key, alliance_teams.team_key, alliance.score from match
inner join alliance on alliance.match_key = match.key
inner join alliance_teams on alliance_teams.alliance_id = alliance.key
where event_key = '2020ncwak' AND
comp_level = 'qm'
```

A very rough statistic ordered by average score.

```{r}
results %>%
  group_by(team_key) %>%
  summarise(m = mean(score), s = sd(score)) %>%
  arrange(desc(m))
```

My model assumes that the score is a linear combination of the contributions of the three teams on the alliance.

$$y = x_1 + x_2 + x_3$$
