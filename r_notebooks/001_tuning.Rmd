Connect to the Cheesecake database to start pulling data.

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(tidyverse)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                      Driver   = "PostgreSQL Unicode",
                      Server   = "localhost",
                      Database = "cheesecake",
                      UID      = "postgres",
                      PWD      = "postgres",
                      Port     = 5432)
```

Get all matches (which are not ties).

```{r}
results <- dbGetQuery(con, "select
	(winning_alliance='red')::int as winner,
	prediction
from match
inner join prediction_history on prediction_history.\"match\"=match.\"key\"
where match.winning_alliance is not null and length(match.winning_alliance) > 0
and model='eloscores'")
```

How good is our calibration?

```{r}
results %>%
  mutate(correct = abs(winner - prediction) < 0.5) %>%
  group_by(gr=cut(prediction, breaks= seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)) ) %>%
  summarise(n= n(), c=mean(correct))
```
