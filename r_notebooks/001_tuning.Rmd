## Elo Score Predictor

Connect to the Cheesecake database to start pulling data.

```{r}
source("shared.R")
```

Get all matches (which are not ties).

```{sql, connection=con}
select 
  avg(power((winning_alliance='red')::int - (prediction->'red')::text::float, 2)) as brier,
	count(*) filter 
		(where (winning_alliance='red' and (prediction->'red')::text::float > 0.5) or (winning_alliance='blue' and (prediction->'red')::text::float < 0.5)) as correct,
	count(*) as count
from match
inner join prediction_history on prediction_history."match"=match."key"
inner join event on match.event_key=event.key
where match.winning_alliance is not null and length(match.winning_alliance) > 0
and model='eloscore2020' and match.event_key like '2020%'
and event.event_type < 7
```

```{sql, connection=con, output.var="results"}
select
	(winning_alliance='red')::int as winner,
	(prediction->'red')::text::float as prediction
from match
inner join prediction_history on prediction_history."match"=match."key"
inner join event on match.event_key=event.key
where match.winning_alliance is not null and length(match.winning_alliance) > 0
and model='eloscore2020'
and event.event_type < 7
```

```{r}
nrow(results)
```

How good is our calibration?

```{r}
rt <- results %>%
  mutate(correct = abs(winner - prediction) < 0.5) %>%
  group_by(gr=cut(prediction, breaks= seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)) ) %>%
  summarise(n= n(), results=mean(correct))
rt[,"results"] = bind_rows(1 - rt[1:5,"results"], rt[6:10,"results"])
rt[,"predicted_range"] = 1:10/10-0.05
rt
```

```{r}
ggplot(rt, aes(x=predicted_range, y=results)) +
  geom_point(aes(size=n)) +
  geom_abline()
```



```{r}
mean((results$prediction - results$winner)^2)
```
