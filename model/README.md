## Background

The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an annual high school robotics competition with teams from over 20 countries. Every year featuers a completely unique game with its own rules and mechanics, offering a unique challenge within sports modeling and prediction. Further, the ability to modify robots *between* competitions means that teams can potentiailly vary significantly in ability from week to week.

Predictions can play an important role in strategy. The most known FRC prediction method is uses least squares to estimate team contributions.

Bayesian statistical methods are an ideal fit for this domain because it accounts for the uncertainty and allows for informed priors where there is little other information.
